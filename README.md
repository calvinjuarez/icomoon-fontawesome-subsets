# Icomoon Font Awesome Subsets

[Icomoon](http://icomoon.io) allows importing icon sets in a JSON format.  These files are Icomoon icon set JSON files that contain subsets of the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) icon font.  Some of the subsets contain functionally related icons—such as icons that would be useful in a text editor, or icons for the ecommerce functions of a site—while other sets contain icons that are similar in their appearance or purpose—like all the arrows and directional icons, or all the brand icons.

## Contributing

This repository is meant so that I don't lose the sets I've created, but if you find these useful, or you think a set should exist that doesn't yet, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.
