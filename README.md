# Icomoon Font Awesome Subsets

[Icomoon](http://icomoon.io) allows importing icon sets in a JSON format.  These files are Icomoon icon set JSON files that contain subsets of the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) icon font.  Some of the subsets contain functionally related icons—such as icons that would be useful in a text editor, or icons for the ecommerce functions of a site—while other sets contain icons that are similar in their appearance or purpose—like all the arrows and directional icons, or all the brand icons.

There is also an empty set file, which makes it easy to create new sets that contain the same meta information and settings as the sets in the repo.

## Contributing

This repository is meant so that I don't lose the sets I've created, but if you find these useful, or you think a set should exist that doesn't yet, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

## License

Note that the icons included in these sets are subject to the Font Awesome license, which can be found at <http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/license>.  The license on this repository applies to everything that is _not_ already covered by the Font Awesome license.
